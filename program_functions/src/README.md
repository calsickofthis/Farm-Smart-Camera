# Facial recognition clock in application <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px" height="30px" />

## This is my repeat project for my college course module - project management - I will upload my project diary when the project is fully finished.

##This application is designed to use opencv and training data to recognize employees of an organization via a digital camera and log when the computer recognizes them - this data is then used to predict when the employee came into work
